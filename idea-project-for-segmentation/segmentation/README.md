# Segmentation

Prototype of a Ford & Fulkerson method of image segmentation.
Developed as an exercise during the [Computer Vision](https://www.coursera.org/course/artificialvision) class on Coursera.

## Install
At the moment, it's only two Java files.
It's completely self contained.

During the development I used Intellij IDEA.
The Eclipse project files are provided as well.


The GUI class has a main method to start the prototype.

## Getting Started

* Run the GUI class - a test image will load and be displayed in a window
* Select the foreground by marking some pixels with the left mouse button
* Select the backround using the right mouse button
* Hit start.

During the execution some partial progress will be displayed.
The final result will show up in a Window with title result.
